      <p>
        I attended the highschool Bronx Academy for Software Engineering and there is where I picked up programming.
        At first I did it because I had to but then it started becoming something more than just a grade I was getting.
        Now years later, I am still very passionate about coding with a focus in Full Stack web development.
        I value community in a workplace which is why I think the ideal workplace for me would be a small startup I can build and grow with.
